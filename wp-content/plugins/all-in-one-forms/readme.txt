All the fields, formulas, conditions and more included in the free version!

= Features =
**Why yet another form builder?**

There are already a bunch of form builder but most of them have a very limited free version which just let you create basic forms, for anything else, you need to pay.

This plugin goes another route offering everything in the form builder for free (that is all the fields, formulas, conditions, emailing etc).

**So everything is free?**

Not everything, in order to continue the plugin development and its support we have to charge for some features, so for now some features of the entries page and the addons are not free, there are addons to integrate with paypal, stripe, create pages with your entries, pdfs etc.
